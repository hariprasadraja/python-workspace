    "This is the last of the values you can actually completely understand from what you've seen on this course. However, there are more that you can at least intuitively understand. Both  (`Omnibus` and `Prob(Omnibus)`) and (`Jarque-Bera (JB)` and `Prob(JB)`) represent hypothesis tests. They are both very particular tests, where the alternative hypothesis is that the residues are not normally distributed. Of course, they are not like any of the tests you've leaned so far, because it doesn't use the same statistics, but the way in which you interpret the test is still the same. The values of `Omnibus` and `Jarque-Bera (JB)` are the values of the statistic of each test, while `Prob(Omnibus)` and `Prob(JB` are the p-values. Note that in both of this tests, a small p-value indicates that the residues are not normally distributed.\n",
